# GitHub Action: is-in-orgs

An action to check if the user who initiated it is a member of one of the
specified orgs. If the user is in one of those orgs, this action will succeed;
otherwise, it will fail. A handy way to do some light authorization.

jobs:
  myJob:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: the job I'm running
    steps:
      - name: check org membership
        id: org-check
        uses: mgwalker/action-is-in-orgs@v2.0.1
        with:
          orgs: org1 org2 org3
     - if: ${{ steps.org-check.in_orgs == 'true' }}
       name: do a thing
       run: "my next command"
```
